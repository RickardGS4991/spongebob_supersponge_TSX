I am migrating an old videogame originally written in C to Typescript. This project involves remastering a classic PlayStation (PSX) game to make it playable in modern web browsers. I am using React for the UI components and Phaser as the game engine to handle rendering, physics and game logic. The goal is to preserve the original gameplay.
